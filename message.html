        <strong>A - Admirable</strong><br>
        You walk with grace, a steady light,<br>
        A beacon shining through the night.<br>
        Your kindness rare, your heart so true,<br>
        Admirable in all you do.<br>
        <br>
        With every step, you pave the way,<br>
        Inspire others, day by day.<br>
        The world is better where you’ve been,<br>
        A soul as pure as sunlight’s sheen.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <strong>B - Brilliant</strong><br>
        Your mind’s a spark, a vivid flare,<br>
A brilliance rare beyond compare.<br>
Ideas bloom where your thoughts go,<br>
A fertile field where wisdom grows.<br>
<br>
You see the world with sharpened sight,<br>
A dazzling star in darkest night.<br>
To call you brilliant is just a start,<br>
Your clever mind reflects your heart.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <strong>I - Inspiring</strong><br>
        You lift the weary, guide the lost,<br>
A helping hand, no thought of cost.<br>
With words of hope, you mend what’s torn,<br>
Inspiring hearts where dreams are born.<br>
<br>
Your courage shines, your strength profound,<br>
A steady voice in chaos found.<br>
You make us believe, you show the way,<br>
Inspiring all to seize the day.<br>
      </p>

    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <strong>N - Noble</strong><br>
        Your heart holds values rich and true,<br>
A noble spirit shines through you.<br>
In every act, your virtue stays,<br>
A quiet strength that lights our days.<br>
<br>
Your selflessness, your calm resolve,<br>
Show how our trials can dissolve.<br>
Noble are you, in thought and deed,<br>
The friend we trust, the guide we need.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <strong>A - Affectionate</strong><br>
        Your heart’s a well of endless care,<br>
  A gentle love beyond compare.<br>
  With every word, with every smile,<br>
  You make this life feel so worthwhile.<br><br>

  Through darkest nights, your warmth will glow,<br>
  A soothing light, a soft tableau.<br>
  Affectionate and truly kind,<br>
  You bring such joy to every mind.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <strong>Y - Youthful</strong><br>
        There’s joy in you that won’t decay,<br>
A youthful spark to light the way.<br>
You see the world with wonder’s eyes,<br>
A spirit free that never dies.<br>
<br>
Your laughter echoes, pure and bright,<br>
A melody that feels so right.<br>
Forever young, your soul will be,<br>
A well of endless energy.<br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
        <strong>A - Amazing</strong><br>
        Amazing is too small a word,<br>
For all the wonders I have heard.<br>
Your deeds, your heart, your radiant glow,<br>
Are more than words could ever show.<br>
<br>
You’re amazing in your quiet care,<br>
In ways that show you’re always there.<br>
A friend, a guide, a shining flame,<br>
Amazing—yes—that’s still your name.<br>

        <strong>!(final points hehe)!</strong><br>
        To be very honest, I'm not that good at communicating and that might cause
        some problems but I'm really glad you still remain my friend despite all that...
        I genuienly don't think I could've asked for a better childhood friend :D.
        I also hope these poems made you happy and I'm looking forward to how the
        rest of our lives will go AHAHAHAHAH but yes, I'm really really <strong>REALLY</strong>
        lucky and grateful to have someone like you in my life :DD.
